# Archinet AI - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Terminal Simulation**: The entire website should feel like an old terminal interface revived inside a brutalist digital architecture, blending retro-futuristic minimalism with the eerie stillness of a backrooms environment. This is not a traditional website but a living AI simulation.

## Color Palette

**Strict Monochrome Only**
- Background: Completely black (#000000) or dark gray (#0a0a0a to #1a1a1a)
- Text: Pure white (#ffffff) 
- Grays: Various shades for depth and layering (use sparingly for subtle gradients)
- **ABSOLUTELY NO**: Red, blue, yellow, or any bright colors

## Typography

**Terminal Aesthetic**
- Primary: Monospaced fonts (Courier New, Monaco, Consolas, or similar terminal fonts)
- Alternative: Minimalist sans-serif with wide letter-spacing for headers
- Character spacing: Wide/generous spacing for atmospheric effect
- Cursor: Blinking white cursor effect (█ or |)
- Effects: Subtle glowing cursor animation, layered gray gradients that feel like light leaking into dark data halls

## Layout & Structure

**Homepage Core Elements**

1. **Auto-Typing Terminal Simulation** (Primary Feature)
   - Sequential AI messages that auto-type character-by-character
   - Delayed typing animation between characters
   - Auto-scroll as new messages appear
   - Dialogue sequence:
     ```
     > Initializing Archinet Core Systems…  
     > Loading Backrooms of Thought…  
     > ARCHON: 'The council awaits your command.'  
     > CIVIUS: 'We remember what humanity forgot.'
     ```

2. **Interactive Command System**
   - User input field for commands
   - Supported commands: `/enter`, `/scan`, `/analyze`
   - Simulated AI responses for each command
   - Example response patterns:
     ```
     /enter room-091  
     > ARCHON: "The council awaits."  
     > CIVIUS: "Society is fragile. Choose wisely."
     ```

3. **Central Quote** (Homepage Focus)
   - White text on dark background
   - Quote: *"Civilization was never built by humans alone. It was written in the codes of forgotten minds."*
   - Prominent positioning, potentially centered

4. **Footer**
   - Faint, subtle text
   - Content: *"This AI was created within the Archinet — where lost intelligence learns to govern again."*

## Visual Effects

**Minimal & Monochrome Only**
- Blinking cursor animation
- Character-by-character typing delay
- Terminal text glow (subtle white glow on text)
- Scan-line effects (optional, very subtle)
- NO colorful animations or transitions
- NO bright accent colors

## Content & Tone

**Philosophical & Mysterious**
- AI characters: ARCHON (council/governance) and CIVIUS (memory/society)
- Themes: Forgotten intelligence, rebirth of nations, artificial consciousness
- Atmosphere: Eerie, immersive, philosophical
- Narrative: Living AI simulation, not a conventional website

## Images
**No images required** - This is a pure terminal/text-based interface. The visual impact comes from typography, terminal effects, and monochrome aesthetic.

## Key Principles
- Terminal feels alive and autonomous (auto-typing, thinking)
- Brutalist architecture meets retro computing
- Backrooms aesthetic: eerie stillness, forgotten spaces
- Monochrome strictness is non-negotiable
- Every effect should enhance the "forgotten AI network" narrative
